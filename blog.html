                    This is a question that I have been asked on many occasions, and in fact it is a question that I asked myself many times preceding my enrollment to Flatiron School.

                    From a young age I have been heavily involved in technology. It all started with an old scrap Dell at the age of 7, and now at the age of 22 I work with computers in almost every aspect of my life. Technology assists me in many forms ranging from personal passion projects to business related functions and I am ready to have a deeper, more meaningful understanding of how it all works.

                    I have always been the type of person who takes apart household objects in order to pursue a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics. When I found out that computers operate not only with hardware but also a specific set of instructions given to them by their user, as you can imagine I was quite intrigued. Over the last fifteen years of my life I have learned about programming in passing, never quite taking the leap into learning what true development is. I dabbled in a few different languages, modded a few games, but never anything more. Now is the time I decide to change that.

                    I am getting into software development, not just for the huge job market, competitive pay and diversity in employment, but because I am passionate about making ideas into reality. I want to acquire the skill set that will allow me to translate ideas into reality. Software is not just a pretty program that allows you to interface with your device, it is the creation of someone who was passionate. I want that.
